      "Rolling perfect round chapatis is considered one of the most critical parts of Indian cuisine. Often, we have seen amateur cooks seeking the help of round utensils like a quarter plate or a saucer to get that perfect shape. But let's confess, it is a bit time-consuming to first knead the dough, roll the rotis and then shape it with utensils. Well, a viral video demonstrates a time-saving way to make perfectly round rotis. The clip, which was shared by an Instagram digital creator (@rajput_jodi_) shows a woman first creating a long roll out of the kneaded dough. She takes the entire dough at once. Next, she flattens it using a rolling pin. After giving the dough a proper width, she uses a big bowl to shape the rotis. The clip shows the woman shaping 4 chapatis and keeping them all on the heated griddle at once. As the bottom chapati gets half-cooked, she tosses it on top of the other burner. She repeats the process with other chapatis. So far the clip has been viewed more than 28 million times.Also Read: Anshula Kapoor Is A Punjabi Foodie And Here Is The Proof You Might Need\n",

      "Spring is here, and we can't keep calm. After surviving the chilly weather, the bright sunshine and fresh breeze finally give us relief. It's probably one of the best times of the year, and most people start making travel plans during this time. However, as much as we welcome the spring season with open arms, we can also fall sick easily during this time. As the weather changes, we are more susceptible to catching an infection. Luckily, you can prevent this by including certain immune-boosting foods and drinks in your diet. Nutritionists also often place emphasis on the importance of starting your day right. During spring, it is essential that you become extra cautious about what you eat or drink in the morning.

      "Erik ten Hag expects to be boosted by the return of Rasmus Hojlund, Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka for Manchester United's FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool. Injury-hit United have endured a poor season and need to overcome Jurgen Klopp's side at Old Trafford on Sunday to keep their hopes of silverware alive. United enter the showdown with their bitter rivals as underdogs, but right-back Wan-Bissaka should return after two months out, with England defender Maguire and Denmark striker Hojlund also set to feature. \"We had a good week. Today we had a session and they were all training,\" Ten Hag said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.\n",

Ice cream, with its myriad flavours and toppings, embodies a miniature celebration in a cone. And let's not overlook matka kulfi - the decadent, creamy delight served in charming earthen pots or on sticks. It evokes nostalgic memories of carefree childhood days. Whether you're lounging with friends or indulging yourself after a taxing day, matka kulfi stands as the quintessential comfort food, guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. But have you ever wondered about the process of making matka kulfi? Well, hold onto your seats, because a viral video on Instagram is about to unveil the secrets.Also Read: Ever Heard Of Paper Mithai? Watch The Making Of This Unique DessertThe video begins with a man pouring milk into a hot wok. He mixes and stirs in all the kulfi ingredients, resulting in a creamy, chocolaty mixture. After letting it cool, he carefully pours it into cylindrical molds, sealing them securely. Then, he fills a large steel pot with ice and places the ice cream moulds inside, allowing them to chill perfectly. After a brief period, he removes one of the moulds, inserts four ice cream sticks, and skillfully cuts the cylindrical kulfi into four individual portions, each with its own stick. And just like that, the matka kulfi is ready to be enjoyed. Watch the video here:\n",

Through Project Dream Library, they endeavour to provide underprivileged children with access to education, recognising it as their fundamental right.The recent expansion at NGO Gurudikshaam saw over 100 books donated to more than 70 underprivileged children, promising not just enlightenment but also potentially altering the trajectory of their families. Recognising education's transformative power, the project believes in the ripple effect, where educating one generation can uplift many more to come.Establishments like the one at Sanjay Camp in 2023, benefiting over 60 children, highlight the tangible impact of the project. Partnerships with changemakers like the Triveni SHG further amplify the reach, spreading the message of education in nearby slums.Looking ahead, the project aims for even broader impact, envisioning ventures into vocational training, specially-abled courses, and regular sessions at institutions catering to the blind and transgender communities.
