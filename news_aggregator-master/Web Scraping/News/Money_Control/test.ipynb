      "Short News: With the nervousness across large-, mid- and small-caps, the bears are expected to keep control over Dalal Street in the coming sessions too. If the Nifty 50 decisively breaks the 21,860 level (the key level for the continuation of higher highs and higher lows formation), then 21,700-21,500 can be the levels to watch going ahead, but if the index manages to rebound, it may face a hurdle at 22,200-22,300 on the higher side, experts said. On March 13, the bloodbath in broader markets on overvaluation concerns raised by the market regulator dented sentiment. The Sensex plunged 906 points to 72,762, while the Nifty 50 fell 338 points or 1.51 percent (the biggest single-day correction since January 23) to 21,998. The broader markets saw major selling pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 index falling 4.4 percent and Smallcap 100 declining 5.3 percent. About 23 shares declined for every rising share on the NSE. What is making the market nervous and how should you navigate the selloff? RIL, ITC and Tata Motors are among the  stocks to watch out for today. Meanwhile, Gopal Snacks is likely to see a muted debut amid the broader market selloff.

The index defended both these supports on closing basis, which is a positive sign. On February 29, the benchmark indices remained volatile and gained strength in late trade.
