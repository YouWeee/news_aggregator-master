      "According to Krishnamurthy Venkata Subramanian, IMF's India executive director, India can achieve sustained 8% economic growth until 2047 by strengthening existing policies and accelerating reforms. Despite India's inconsistent 8% growth rate, Subramanian believes it is attainable. The economy grew 8.4% in Q4 2023, leading to a 7.6% projection for the current fiscal year. Subramanian emphasizes the need for domestic economic growth, given that 58% of India's GDP comes from domestic consumption. Job creation through manufacturing should be encouraged. Subramanian also highlighted the necessity for reforms in sectors such as land, labor, capital, and logistics, as well as in the banking sector to provide credit for manufacturing. Achieving 8% growth could result in India becoming a $55 trillion economy by 2047.\n",
